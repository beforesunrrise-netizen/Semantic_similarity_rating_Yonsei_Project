# OpenAI API Key Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: OpenAI API is DISABLED by default for security
# To enable OpenAI features:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the placeholder below with your actual API key
# 3. Make sure .env is in your .gitignore

# Uncomment and set your key to enable OpenAI features
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here

# By default, the application will NOT work without a valid API key
# This is intentional to prevent accidental API usage and charges
